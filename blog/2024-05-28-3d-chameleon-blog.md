Let’s talk about upgrading to multicolor 3d printing. 

<!-- truncate -->

We have a few different ways we can accomplish this in today’s market. The easiest is to just buy a printer that has everything we need ready to go! The printer in question is the new hotness [BambuLabs](https://us.store.bambulab.com/) series of printers. You do need to by the AMS or multi-color unit as an add on. We also have a variety of other units that we can buy. A new contender is the [CoPrint](https://coprint3d.com/collections/all) system which is expensive as is an older company in the space called [Mosaic](https://shorturl.at/alLP0). Both are over $500 to get started. The 3d Chameleon on the other hand is $179 and like the previous two you can add this to any printer. Obviously with the cheaper price comes some manual labor but it’s very doable.

How does the Chameleon work? It is basically a switching mechanism that has a Y adapter. Sounds simple until you get into actually running it. The Chameleon is on the third version with a fourth on the way very soon. Every version is obviously easier for the end user which is a good thing. The first and second version has  the same but different than the latest hardware. The good news is the difference is just a print away which is conveniently open sourced. Being open source is another reason I like this product. 

According to the website which is slightly misleading one can achieve multicolor on any machine. If you want to put this on a machine that hasn’t been used yet you have to do some modeling plus tinkering in code. We are not talking in depth coding just some g-code which you probably already know so it won’t be to difficult plus he has a code generator for us on his site. I have spent a few days already modeling up a mount only to find out it is the hardest version to get working than the other ways available. The good news is because it’s such a small community, Bill the inventor is hands on and has a forum that he keeps up to date on. If you are reading this and the Chameleon takes off with many more users I would imagine that he won’t be able to keep up with a ton of questions only being one person.

So far I have printed a few of the mounts and think I have the one I need and I have also messed around trying to get a 3d Clippy, another of his inventions, to work with my printer. I haven’t yet gotten that to work but I am giving it a good try. I have gotten the Chameleon all installed and have done a test to see if things move properly and they do. I did make the mistake of adding a new extruder to my printer and I now have to bypass the Chameleon to get that working properly. Once I do I will be happily multi-color printing.

 To install the Chameleon it really couldn’t be that much easier. The hardest part is having to run the wires so they are out of the way and hat is no big deal. I think in the next post i will have already printed with the thing and will be able to report back on how well I got it working. I know that it works well because I have seen others posting on how they are doing. I wish you luck in all your printing and please wish me some over here!

## Exploring Multicolor 3D Printing: My experience with the 3D Chameleon

Multicolor 3D printing opens up a world of creativity and innovation, allowing for more complex and visually striking models. In today's market, several options are available for achieving this, ranging from fully integrated systems to DIY add-ons. Here, I'll share my experience with different systems and my journey with the 3D Chameleon, an open-source solution that's making waves for its affordability and adaptability.

### The Landscape of Multicolor 3D Printing

**BambuLabs Series**

The BambuLabs series represents the high-end of multicolor 3D printing solutions. These printers come nearly ready to go but require an additional AMS unit for multicolor capabilities. While they offer high-quality prints with minimal manual labor, the initial investment is substantial.

**CoPrint and Mosaic Systems**

Both CoPrint and Mosaic are reputable names in the multicolor 3D printing space. These systems can be integrated into various printers, offering reliable performance. However, they come with a price tag of over $500, which might be a deterrent for hobbyists or those on a budget.

**3D Chameleon**

Enter the 3D Chameleon. Priced at just $179, this system offers an affordable entry into the world of multicolor printing. It’s designed to be added to any printer, making it highly versatile. As with any budget-friendly option, it requires some manual labor and technical know-how, but it's a feasible project for those willing to get their hands dirty.

### How the 3D Chameleon Works

The 3D Chameleon is essentially a filament switching mechanism that uses a Y adapter to switch between different filaments. While the concept is simple, the execution requires careful setup and configuration. The latest version, Chameleon 3, is a significant improvement over its predecessors, offering easier installation and operation. Moreover, with the fourth version on the horizon, things are only getting better.

One of the standout features of the 3D Chameleon is its open-source nature. This not only keeps costs down but also fosters a community of users who contribute to its ongoing improvement. The hardware differences between versions are minimal and can be 3D printed, further enhancing its DIY appeal.

### My Experience and Setup

When I first decided to try the 3D Chameleon, I was drawn by its affordability and the open-source philosophy behind it. The website promised multicolor capabilities for any machine, but I soon learned that some modeling and code tinkering were required. Fortunately, the G-code adjustments were straightforward, thanks to a code generator available on the site.

The installation process was relatively easy, with the main challenge being wire management to keep everything tidy and functional. After printing a few mounts and experimenting with different setups, I finally found a configuration that worked well with my printer. I am still trying to incorporate 3d Clippy with my Ender Max but I am sure I will soon find the design version that will work for me.

### Challenges and Community Support

One of the initial hurdles I faced was integrating a new extruder with the Chameleon system. This required bypassing the Chameleon temporarily to get the extruder working correctly. Despite these challenges, the supportive community and active involvement of Bill, the inventor, made a significant difference. His hands-on approach and the forum he maintains are invaluable resources for troubleshooting and advice.

### Looking Forward

As I continue to fine-tune my setup and run more test prints, I'm optimistic about the results. The Chameleon system has proven to be a capable and cost-effective solution for multicolor 3D printing. Its open-source nature and the vibrant community around it are huge advantages that make the journey enjoyable.

### Final Thoughts

Exploring multicolor 3D printing with the 3D Chameleon has been a very fun adventure. While it requires more manual effort than some pricier options, the satisfaction of achieving multicolor prints with a DIY approach is totally worth it. If you're considering diving into multicolor printing and don't mind a bit of tinkering, the 3D Chameleon is definitely worth a try.

Happy printing, and may your creations be colorful and your filament dry!
