Whether you’re dialing in a 3D printer, swinging a hammer, welding a frame, or programming a CNC router, I’m stoked to have you here in my little digital workshop. \n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\nI’m just a regular older guy who’s spent decades tinkering in the garage, and this blog is my way of inviting you along for the ride. It’ll mostly focus on 3D printing help—because, let’s face it, those machines can be a puzzle—but I’ve got plenty to say about woodworking, metalworking, and CNC projects too, all from a DIY, learn-as-you-go angle. Oh, and I’ll toss in some thoughts on AI and how it’s sneaking into the life of a guy like me and the broader Maker community. Grab a coffee, and let’s get into it!\n\n## What’s This Blog About?\n\nPicture this: a cluttered garage with a 3D printer humming in one corner, a workbench covered in sawdust, and a welder sparking in the back. That’s my world, and this blog is where I’ll spill the beans on what I’m up to. **3D printing** will take center stage—I’m talking troubleshooting (like my recent battle with a CR Touch error), mods to make cheap printers punch above their weight, and fun projects like custom tool holders. But I’m not stopping there. Expect:\n- **Woodworking**: I’ve built everything from jigs to bookshelves, and I’ll share the tricks I’ve learned—like how to square a joint without a fancy planer.\n- **Metalworking**: Think practical stuff—welding a cart for my tools or grinding down scrap into something useful. No industrial shop required.\n- **CNC Projects**: I’m still getting the hang of my little CNC router, so we’ll figure out carving wood and cutting metal together.\n\nThis isn’t about glossy perfection. It’s about real projects, real mistakes, and real learning. I’m no pro with a shop full of $10,000 tools—I’m the guy who started with a secondhand drill and a dream. If you’re here to roll up your sleeves and make something, you’re my kind of people.\n\n## A DIY and Learning Mindset\n\nI’ve always been a hands-on learner. Take my first woodworking project: a wobbly stool that looked like it’d collapse if you breathed on it. But I kept at it, and now I’ve got a garage full of stuff I’m proud of. This blog is about that journey—sharing what I’ve figured out so you can skip some of my dumb mistakes. I’ll break down projects step-by-step, from sketch to finish, and throw in tips for beginners and old hands alike. Got a better way to do something? Tell me in the comments—I’m not too stubborn to learn from you.\n\n## AI and the Regular Older Guy Life\n\nNow, let’s talk about something wild: **AI**. I grew up with rotary phones and rabbit-ear TVs, so seeing artificial intelligence pop up in my workshop feels like science fiction. But it’s real, and I’m hooked. I’ve been using AI tools—like Grok from xAI—to brainstorm fixes for my 3D printer or even draft these posts when my brain’s fried. It’s like having a super-smart buddy who never sleeps.\n\nI’ll dive deeper in future posts, but here’s my take: AI’s changing the DIY game. Imagine software that designs a 3D model for you, or a CNC machine that tweaks its own settings mid-cut. It’s exciting, but as a guy who’d rather smell wood glue than code, I wonder—will it make us lazy, or just better? I see it helping the Maker community big-time—think faster prototyping or catching errors before you waste a sheet of plywood. Still, I’m keeping it practical: how does this fit into a life of duct tape and WD-40? We’ll explore that together.\n\n## Why I’m Here\n\nThis blog is my thank-you to the Maker community. I’ve spent hours on forums, watching YouTube fixes, and digging through Reddit threads—y’all have saved my bacon more times than I can count. Now I want to pay it forward. Plus, writing this keeps me honest. It forces me to finish projects, document the chaos, and try stuff I’d otherwise put off—like that CNC sign I’ve been sketching for months. Most of all, I’m here to connect with folks who get the buzz of turning a pile of junk into something cool.\n\n## Let’s Make Stuff Together\n\nSo, here’s the deal: I’ll post about 3D printing quirks, woodworking builds, metal hacks, and CNC adventures as I go. Some weeks I’ll have a polished guide; others, it’ll be a “help, my printer’s on fire” rant. The AI stuff? That’ll pop up when I’ve got something worth saying—like how it helped me debug a filament jam last week. No strict schedule—just real talk when inspiration (or disaster) strikes.\n\nWhat do you want to see? Stuck on a project? Swear by a tool I need to try? Hit me up on X @devmobnow—I’m all about swapping ideas. Here’s to making, breaking, and making again. Welcome to the crew!\n\n---\n*Last updated: March 18, 2025*"},{"id":"3d-chameleon","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/3d-chameleon","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2024-05-28-3d-chameleon-blog.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-28-3d-chameleon-blog.md","title":"3D Chameleon","description":"Let’s talk about upgrading to multicolor 3d printing.","date":"2024-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"3D Printing","permalink":"/blog/tags/3d-printing","description":"3D Printing tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Maker","permalink":"/blog/tags/maker","description":"Maker tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"3D Chameleon","permalink":"/blog/tags/3d-chameleon","description":"3D Chameleon tag description"}],"readingTime":6.345,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"3d-chameleon","title":"3D Chameleon","tags":["3d-printing","maker","3d-chameleon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome to My Maker Blog: DIY, Learning, and a Dash of AI","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"Let’s talk about upgrading to multicolor 3d printing. \n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\nWe have a few different ways we can accomplish this in today’s market. The easiest is to just buy a printer that has everything we need ready to go! The printer in question is the new hotness [BambuLabs](https://us.store.bambulab.com/) series of printers. You do need to by the AMS or multi-color unit as an add on. We also have a variety of other units that we can buy. A new contender is the [CoPrint](https://coprint3d.com/collections/all) system which is expensive as is an older company in the space called [Mosaic](https://shorturl.at/alLP0). Both are over $500 to get started. The 3d Chameleon on the other hand is $179 and like the previous two you can add this to any printer. Obviously with the cheaper price comes some manual labor but it’s very doable.\n\nHow does the Chameleon work? It is basically a switching mechanism that has a Y adapter. Sounds simple until you get into actually running it. The Chameleon is on the third version with a fourth on the way very soon. Every version is obviously easier for the end user which is a good thing. The first and second version has  the same but different than the latest hardware. The good news is the difference is just a print away which is conveniently open sourced. Being open source is another reason I like this product. \n\nAccording to the website which is slightly misleading one can achieve multicolor on any machine. If you want to put this on a machine that hasn’t been used yet you have to do some modeling plus tinkering in code. We are not talking in depth coding just some g-code which you probably already know so it won’t be to difficult plus he has a code generator for us on his site. I have spent a few days already modeling up a mount only to find out it is the hardest version to get working than the other ways available. The good news is because it’s such a small community, Bill the inventor is hands on and has a forum that he keeps up to date on. If you are reading this and the Chameleon takes off with many more users I would imagine that he won’t be able to keep up with a ton of questions only being one person.\n\nSo far I have printed a few of the mounts and think I have the one I need and I have also messed around trying to get a 3d Clippy, another of his inventions, to work with my printer. I haven’t yet gotten that to work but I am giving it a good try. I have gotten the Chameleon all installed and have done a test to see if things move properly and they do. I did make the mistake of adding a new extruder to my printer and I now have to bypass the Chameleon to get that working properly. Once I do I will be happily multi-color printing.\n\n To install the Chameleon it really couldn’t be that much easier. The hardest part is having to run the wires so they are out of the way and hat is no big deal. I think in the next post i will have already printed with the thing and will be able to report back on how well I got it working. I know that it works well because I have seen others posting on how they are doing. I wish you luck in all your printing and please wish me some over here!\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Exploring Multicolor 3D Printing: My experience with the 3D Chameleon\n\nMulticolor 3D printing opens up a world of creativity and innovation, allowing for more complex and visually striking models. In today's market, several options are available for achieving this, ranging from fully integrated systems to DIY add-ons. Here, I'll share my experience with different systems and my journey with the 3D Chameleon, an open-source solution that's making waves for its affordability and adaptability.\n\n### The Landscape of Multicolor 3D Printing\n\n**BambuLabs Series**\n\nThe BambuLabs series represents the high-end of multicolor 3D printing solutions. These printers come nearly ready to go but require an additional AMS unit for multicolor capabilities. While they offer high-quality prints with minimal manual labor, the initial investment is substantial.\n\n**CoPrint and Mosaic Systems**\n\nBoth CoPrint and Mosaic are reputable names in the multicolor 3D printing space. These systems can be integrated into various printers, offering reliable performance. However, they come with a price tag of over $500, which might be a deterrent for hobbyists or those on a budget.\n\n**3D Chameleon**\n\nEnter the 3D Chameleon. Priced at just $179, this system offers an affordable entry into the world of multicolor printing. It’s designed to be added to any printer, making it highly versatile. As with any budget-friendly option, it requires some manual labor and technical know-how, but it's a feasible project for those willing to get their hands dirty.\n\n### How the 3D Chameleon Works\n\nThe 3D Chameleon is essentially a filament switching mechanism that uses a Y adapter to switch between different filaments. While the concept is simple, the execution requires careful setup and configuration. The latest version, Chameleon 3, is a significant improvement over its predecessors, offering easier installation and operation. Moreover, with the fourth version on the horizon, things are only getting better.\n\nOne of the standout features of the 3D Chameleon is its open-source nature. This not only keeps costs down but also fosters a community of users who contribute to its ongoing improvement. The hardware differences between versions are minimal and can be 3D printed, further enhancing its DIY appeal.\n\n### My Experience and Setup\n\nWhen I first decided to try the 3D Chameleon, I was drawn by its affordability and the open-source philosophy behind it. The website promised multicolor capabilities for any machine, but I soon learned that some modeling and code tinkering were required. Fortunately, the G-code adjustments were straightforward, thanks to a code generator available on the site.\n\nThe installation process was relatively easy, with the main challenge being wire management to keep everything tidy and functional. After printing a few mounts and experimenting with different setups, I finally found a configuration that worked well with my printer. I am still trying to incorporate 3d Clippy with my Ender Max but I am sure I will soon find the design version that will work for me.\n\n### Challenges and Community Support\n\nOne of the initial hurdles I faced was integrating a new extruder with the Chameleon system. This required bypassing the Chameleon temporarily to get the extruder working correctly. Despite these challenges, the supportive community and active involvement of Bill, the inventor, made a significant difference. His hands-on approach and the forum he maintains are invaluable resources for troubleshooting and advice.\n\n### Looking Forward\n\nAs I continue to fine-tune my setup and run more test prints, I'm optimistic about the results. The Chameleon system has proven to be a capable and cost-effective solution for multicolor 3D printing. Its open-source nature and the vibrant community around it are huge advantages that make the journey enjoyable.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nExploring multicolor 3D printing with the 3D Chameleon has been a very fun adventure. While it requires more manual effort than some pricier options, the satisfaction of achieving multicolor prints with a DIY approach is totally worth it. If you're considering diving into multicolor printing and don't mind a bit of tinkering, the 3D Chameleon is definitely worth a try.\n\nHappy printing, and may your creations be colorful and your filament dry!"}]}}
