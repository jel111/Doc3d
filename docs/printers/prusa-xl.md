## 🚀 What Is the Prusa XL?

The **Prusa XL** is Prusa Research’s **large-format CoreXY** 3D printer designed for **precision, speed**, and **modularity**. It’s their answer to the demand for **bigger**, **faster**, and **more professional-grade** printing. This thing was engineered for prosumers, educators, and small-scale manufacturers who need industrial performance with Prusa’s famous plug-and-play simplicity.

With an optional **tool changer** system, this is also Prusa’s first **multi-tool CoreXY**—think **multi-material** and **multi-color**, all on one machine.
