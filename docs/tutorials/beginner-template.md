# Your First 3D Print: A Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the world of 3D printing! Whether you’re a hobbyist, a tinkerer, or just curious, this guide will walk you through the essentials of getting your first 3D print off the ground. No jargon overload—just the basics to get you started.

## What You’ll Need
Before diving in, let’s make sure you have the essentials:

1. **A 3D Printer**: Popular beginner options include the Creality Ender 3, Prusa Mini, or Anycubic Kobra. (Pick one you own or recommend!)
2. **Filament**: PLA is the go-to for beginners—it’s easy to use and widely available. Start with a 1.75mm spool in a color you like.
3. **Slicer Software**: This turns 3D models into printer instructions. Free options like Cura, PrusaSlicer, or Creality Slicer work great.
4. **A 3D Model File**: Look for .STL files on sites like [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/), [MyMiniFactory](https://www.myminifactory.com/), or [Printables](https://www.printables.com/).
5. **Basic Tools**: A spatula (for removing prints), a pair of pliers, and some isopropyl alcohol for cleaning the print bed.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Printer
- **Unbox and Assemble**: Follow your printer’s manual. Most entry-level printers come partly assembled—don’t skip the instructions!
- **Level the Bed**: A level print bed is key to success. Use the paper trick: adjust the bed screws until a sheet of paper slides between the nozzle and bed with slight resistance.
- **Load the Filament**: Heat the nozzle (usually to 200°C for PLA), feed the filament through the extruder, and watch it ooze out a little. You’re ready!

## Step 2: Pick Your First Model
Start simple. A classic beginner print is **[3DBenchy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622)** (the 3D printing benchmark boat)—it’s small, quick, and tests your printer’s accuracy. Download it from Thingiverse or your favorite model site.

## Step 3: Slice the Model
- Open your slicer software and import the .STL file.
- Set these beginner-friendly settings for PLA:
  - **Layer Height**: 0.2mm (good balance of speed and quality)
  - **Print Speed**: 50mm/s
  - **Nozzle Temp**: 200°C
  - **Bed Temp**: 60°C (or unheated if your printer allows)
  - **Infill**: 20% (strong enough without wasting filament)
- Hit “Slice,” preview the result, and save the file to an SD card or send it directly to your printer.

## Step 4: Print It!
- Insert the SD card (or connect via USB if that’s your setup).
- Select your file from the printer’s menu and press start.
- Watch the first layer closely—it should stick flat and even, not stringy or peeling. If it’s off, pause and re-level the bed.

## Step 5: Remove and Admire
- Once it’s done, let the print cool for a minute.
- Use your spatula to gently lift it off the bed. If it’s stuck, a little wiggle helps.
- Check out your work! Don’t worry if it’s not perfect—every print teaches you something.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Print Won’t Stick?** Clean the bed with isopropyl alcohol or add painter’s tape/glue stick for grip.
- **Stringy Mess?** Lower the nozzle temp by 5-10°C.
- **Warped Edges?** Ensure your bed is level and try a brim or raft in the slicer.

## What’s Next?
Congrats on your first print! Try tweaking settings, explore new models, or visit [3dprint.help](https://3dprint.help) for more tips and resources. The only limit is your imagination.
